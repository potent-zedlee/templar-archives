          <h2>1. What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
          <p>
            Affiliate links are special URLs that track when visitors from our website sign up or make purchases on partner websites.
            If you click an affiliate link and complete an action (e.g., sign up for a poker site), we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
          <p>
            Templar Archives Index is a free service. Affiliate commissions help us:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cover server costs (hosting, databases, AI processing)</li>
            <li>Maintain and improve the platform</li>
            <li>Keep the Service free for all users</li>
            <li>Continue developing new features</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Our Affiliate Partners</h2>
          <p>
            We may have affiliate relationships with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Poker Sites:</strong> GGPoker, PokerStars, 888poker, partypoker, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Poker Tools:</strong> Training sites, software, tracking tools</li>
            <li><strong>Poker Books & Courses:</strong> Educational materials</li>
            <li><strong>Poker Events:</strong> Live tournament ticket sales</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            Note: This list is not exhaustive. Any time you see a link to a poker-related service, assume it may be an affiliate link.
          </p>

          <h2>4. How Commissions Work</h2>
          <p>
            Different partners have different commission structures:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):</strong> We earn a one-time payment when you sign up</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Share:</strong> We earn a percentage of rake/fees you generate (ongoing)</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Combination of CPA + revenue share</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> You never pay more because of an affiliate link. Prices are the same whether you use our link or visit directly.
            In some cases, our links may provide exclusive bonuses or promotions.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Our Editorial Independence</h2>
          <p>
            We maintain editorial independence in all our content:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hand history data is objective and not influenced by affiliate relationships</li>
            <li>Search results are based on actual hand data, not commission rates</li>
            <li>Player statistics and analysis are unbiased</li>
            <li>Community discussions are user-generated and uncensored (within our <a href="/legal/terms" className="text-primary hover:underline">Terms</a>)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do NOT:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hide or manipulate hand data based on affiliate deals</li>
            <li>Recommend services solely because of higher commissions</li>
            <li>Remove negative information about affiliate partners</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. FTC Compliance</h2>

          <h2>8. Your Choice</h2>
          <p>
