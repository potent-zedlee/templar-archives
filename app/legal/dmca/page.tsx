          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Templar Archives respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same.
            In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(c),
            we will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement on our Service.
          </p>

          <h2>2. DMCA Safe Harbor</h2>
          <p>
            As a service provider, we qualify for DMCA "safe harbor" protection under 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(c) because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We do not have actual knowledge of infringing material</li>
            <li>We do not financially benefit from infringing activity</li>
            <li>Upon receiving proper notification, we act expeditiously to remove or disable access to infringing material</li>
            <li>We have designated an agent to receive DMCA takedown notices</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Fair Use Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We believe our use of poker video content qualifies as Fair Use under 17 U.S.C. ยง 107:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Educational and transformative (converting video to hand history data)</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Published broadcasts, not unpublished works</li>
            <li><strong>Amount:</strong> Limited clips/timestamps, not full broadcasts</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Does not substitute for original content; drives traffic to original sources</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you disagree with our Fair Use analysis, please contact us using the DMCA process below.
          </p>
