          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Templar Archives Index respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same.
            In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512(c),
            we will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement on our Service.
          </p>

          <h2>2. DMCA Safe Harbor</h2>
          <p>
            As a service provider, we qualify for DMCA &quot;safe harbor&quot; protection under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We do not have actual knowledge of infringing material</li>
            <li>We do not financially benefit from infringing activity</li>
            <li>Upon receiving proper notification, we act expeditiously to remove or disable access to infringing material</li>
            <li>We have designated an agent to receive DMCA takedown notices</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Fair Use Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We believe our use of poker video content qualifies as Fair Use under 17 U.S.C. § 107:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Educational and transformative (converting video to hand history data)</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Published broadcasts, not unpublished works</li>
            <li><strong>Amount:</strong> Limited clips/timestamps, not full broadcasts</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Does not substitute for original content; drives traffic to original sources</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you disagree with our Fair Use analysis, please contact us using the DMCA process below.
